## HighDimGF: High-Dimensional Analysis of Gradient Flow for the Matrix Factorization Problem

This project implements gradient flow for the matrix factorization 
problem. The code base is designed to augment our forthcoming 
publication. It is modular and should be easy to use. 
This repository contains some simple examples as well as the 
scripts to reproduce the figures in the paper and will be updated
in the future with more examples and applications.
